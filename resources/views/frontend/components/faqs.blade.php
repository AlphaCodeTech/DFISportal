                <h4>I HAVE A QUESTION WHO CAN I TALK TO?</h4>
                <p>
                    If your question is about the curriculum, class room procedures or your child’s progress, please
                    talk to the class teacher or year group leader. You can also email direct to your child’s
                    teacher via the email link below.

                    The headteacher or deputy headteacher is available if your question cannot be answered in this
                    way. Questions about issues such as dinner money, holidays and absence should be addressed to
                    the school office.

                <h4>WHEN CAN I TALK TO MY HILD'S TEACHER?</h4>
                <p>We recommend seeing your child’s teacher at the end of the school day when they have more time to
                    deal with you, than at the start of the day, which is always a bit hectic!
                    An appointment can be made between yourself and the class teacher via your child/ren’s school
                    planner.
